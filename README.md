# STADS grade notifier 
Notifies by playing a YouTube video when a new grade is added.

## Description
When a new graded is added to the list while the script is running, a YouTube video will play. The notifier refreshes every 420 seconds(7 min) until a new grade is up.  It uses selenium to get the information, which also is a requirement. The YouTube link can be changed as well as the two links for the STADS login page and the STADS result page. Change both STADS links according to your university. Enjoy the spaghetti!
